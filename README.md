## Level 0             
        
2 ^ 38 = 274877906944               
                   
-> 274877906944            
             

           
## Level 1              
              
a-c, b-d, c-e, ...            
               
sol 1) using ascii.. (my first try)                 
sol 2) using string.maketrans()   (recommended)            
            
-> ocr         
         
         
         
## Level 2       
        
regex is the best :)      
    
-> equality             
            
           
          
## Level 3
     
Need to find EXACTLY like XXXxXXX.   
XXXXxXXX (x)   xXXXxXXXx (o)       
             
-> linkedlist             
         
          
           
## Level 4     
       
_"urllib may help. DON'T TRY ALL NOTHINGS, since it will never end. 400 times is more than enough."_       
There are three hints...         
1) use urlib.       
2) number in 'nothings' changes.(click image)      
3) maximum of iteration can be 400.       
       
First click the picture, and you can go to the next page.        
After, putting number inside 'nothing' on and on... (runs 250 times)       
       
sol) crawling!      
It runs 250 times, so number of 249 is the answer.          
       
-> peak        
           
       
         
## Level 5    
      
peak hell -> pickle        
       
('', 95) -> '' x 95 and ('#', 14) -> '#' x 14 (you will see after picle.load()...)      
        
sol) use python pickle    

-> channel
